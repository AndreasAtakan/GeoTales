## TODO

##### 20.nov 2021

- X Scene media (bilder)
- X Import/Export

- (?) Use map bounds instead of center/zoom. Small devices needs to show the entire map-extent
- Bug; when scenes are rearranged, the basemap "last_basemap" mechanism needs to update the scenes basemap value so that the last basemap is still the same basemap as before the reordering
